_Li Yong-Rui_ (LYR) offers a 15% discount on all ships and outfitting in every system he controls. This discount carries over to your rebuy cost.

If the discovery scanner is bound to the fire group, press and hold to charge it up and then honk.
If you're stressing for fire group space you can enter your FFS and it'll prompt you to fire the pulse as well and list the binding at the bottom of the screen.

When it says 'orbital plane established', it's done it's job.
Honking reveals the main stars in a system, and all the bodies in the system that a fellow player has discovered and banked, so basically everywhere in the bubble.

You get credits for every body scanned and a bonus for fully scanning a system.
You can take this a step further by using the DSS to map the surface of planets with probes.

Once again you get a bonus for mapping everything.

When approaching a planet, maintain 7 seconds until gravity well and then around about 12 seconds till glide.

>You can't glide steeper than 60°
